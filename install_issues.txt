#several issues on MAC, PyCharm

1. Climada python version 3.9.*, make sure it's the correct python version. No need separately install, use PyCharm to install, no need to install Anaconda either.\

2. "osgeos not found": can't install osgeos but can install gdal, the same. but climada has a line "from osgeos import gdal", so it still needs osgeos, just change climada's code to "import gdal".
If using conda to install, the package may be installed into other folders, need to mannually copy paste to the project environment.\

3. issues "certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate": Some issue between Mac and python, since some version, python cannot leverage Mac's certificate, so need a separate one.
First need to have a file generate certificates, stored in this folder as well. Run that code, a file called "Certificates.command" is generated. Don't know why "./Install\\ Certificates.command" doesn't work on Mac, even in the same directory, so need to mannualy find the command file, double click  to run. if still not working, run below:\

"
import ssl
import certifi

ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context}
"
